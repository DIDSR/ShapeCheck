### Abstract:
Synthetic data provides a promising solution to address data scarcity for training machine learning models; however, adopting it without proper quality assessments may introduce artifacts, distortions, and unrealistic features that compromise model performance and clinical utility.
This work introduces a novel knowledge-based method for detecting network-induced shape artifacts in synthetic images. The method can detect anatomically unrealistic images irrespective of the generative model used and provides interpretability through its knowledge-based design. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for identifying network-induced shape artifacts using two synthetic mammography datasets.
A reader study further confirmed that images identified by the method as likely containing network-induced artifacts were also flagged by human readers. This method is a step forward in the responsible use of synthetic data by ensuring that synthetic images adhere to realistic anatomical and shape constraints.
